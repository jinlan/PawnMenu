PawnMenu allow you to specify a pawn to eat specified kind of food first.

100CellsRule: Animal pawn has a max food search distance of 100. That means if an animal is 100 cells away from your specified food, he will not go to eat your specified food. Theoretically I can rise it to 9999, but I belive it has been set to 100 for performance reason, so I leave it to 100.
